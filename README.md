# Learning to rank (LTR)

Just experimenting LTR algorithms in Python and Scala on the [MSLR datasets](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/mslr).

Check my [article](https://briefbytes.com/2022/Learning-to-rank-and-ML-pipelines/) for more details.

## Usage

To run the Python notebook you need numpy, pandas, sklearn and xgboost (use the same version as the Scala app).

```
sbt -no-colors -mem 4000 run
```
